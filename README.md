# Weather-API
Python Weather Data Analysis Tool. 
This application allows the user to input any city, which will retrieve: Current Weather and Historical Statistics, such as the average, median and mode for the last 7 days. The 7 day date range is prior days as at current when running the application.

No API key is required for the URL's used:

Longitude & Latitude retrieval: "https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name={city}&count=1"

Actual Weather data retrieval: "https://historical-forecast-api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast"

Open-Meteo requires the Longitude and Latitude of the input city to retrieve the weather data. 
The date format required is ISO6801, which is yyyy-mm-dd.

The following third party libraries require installation.

```pip install requests```

```pip install pandas```

**How to install a virtual environment to run this project:**
1. Open the Command Prompt screen (cmd)
2. Chose an environment name, such as _test_
3. Use the command python -m venv _test_ or py -m venv _test_
4. Active the environment and use _test_\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source _test_/bin/activate (Mac)

**Comments/Notes on the python code:**

<ins>_import libraries_</ins>
* `requests`: allows HTTP requests
* `json`: data transfer on the web
* `datetime`: allows date conversions
* `pandas/numpy`: mathematical calculations

<ins>Part 1:</ins> The user will need to input a city name, if there is no data for that city, it will reflect errors (depending on the issue). These could be:
- Incorrect city input
- No weather data
- Website errors

<ins>Part 2:</ins> Info Status Code 200 means the input city found the data requested. 
- This will retrieve the City's Longitude and Latitude first
- It will print: Longitude, Latitude, Current Date & Time and the 7 day date range

<ins>Part 3:</ins> The calculations for Current Date & Time and the 7 day range includes:
- datetime.now() for the date and time as at when the user inputs the city
- current.strftime ensure the correct date format as yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss or yyyy-mm-dd
- This is the format required for Open-Meteo to retrieve the weather data, as their website uses date format ISO6801
- timedelta is used to calculate the date range between 7 days prior and current date

<ins>Part 4:</ins> info = `requests.get(URL1, timeout=10)`
- the information retrieved from URL1 is stored in info
- ensuring a 10 second timeout if there is no response
- if the info status code is 200, it will retrieve the Longitude and Latitude of the input city
- else it will provide errors. Such as No city found, or info status error code, or other exceptions (HTTP request issue, Value error or Key error)

<ins>Part 5:</ins> with the above Longitude & Longitude, current date & time and 7 day date range, we can use URL2 to retrieve actual weather data.
- params is a dictionary that includes all specific data required from the URL2
- `data` = requests.get(URL2, params=params, timeout=10) retrieves the data and saves it into "data"

<ins>Part 6:</ins> Info Status Code 200 means the Longitude & Latitude retrieved prior will result in information.
- the requested information is current weather temperature in degrees celsius and will print this information

<ins>Part 7:</ins> a blank list for historical weather temperatures is created to avoid "possibly used before assignment" error.
- if all of the above is successful, it will retrieve and save the 7 day date range weather temperature data to run the statistical calculations

<ins>Part 8:</ins> the average, median and mode is calculated.
- `arr`: used numpy to create a historical data array
- `ave1`: used numpy average calculation
- `ave2`: round off the ave1 output to align to all other data output (1 decimal)
- `med1`: used numpy median calculation
- `med2`: round off the med1 output to align to all other data output (1 decimal)
- `mod1`: panda conversion and mode calculation
- `mod_con`: converts mod1 into a normal list as panda list cannot be read in json format

<ins>Part 9:</ins> mod1 can result in one output value or multiple outputs, therefore correct formatting for each scenario is required.
- `mod1.iloc[0]` is used for only one output result, without pulling through additional information that is not a number
- `", ".join([f"{temp}Â°C"` is used for multiple outputs. It will combine all output numbers into one string, seperated with commas. This helps with readability from the user.

<ins>Part 10:</ins> if the above is all successful, the user will see the print of:
- city they input
- the longitude of the city 
- the latitude of the city
- the current date and time
- the start and end date of the 7 day date range
- the current temperature
- the 7 day average temperature
- the 7 day median temperature
- the 7 daye mode temperature/s

<ins>Part 11:</ins> the above print information will be saved into a json document.
- the document will be saved with the name: _city input and current date & time_ _weather
- the document will be saved in the same folder as the .py document was saved in
- `encoding= "utf-8"` ensures that which ever text editor program you use to view the json in, it will not affect the degrees celsius sign
- `indent= 4` ensures a neat output that can be read easily by the user
- `ensure_ascii= False` ensures that the degrees celcius does not pull through as \u00b0C on the json document
